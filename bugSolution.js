To fix type errors, carefully check the expected prop types of the components you're using. Ensure that the data types you're passing match the expected types. Use TypeScript to catch type errors during development, improving code quality.  Always ensure your state updates use the correct data types. When dealing with promises, always handle potential errors and ensure the resolved value is of the expected type.  Explicit type declarations with TypeScript can drastically reduce these errors. 

```javascript
// Correct prop type
<MyComponent someProp={'123'} />

// Correct data type in state
this.setState({ count: 123 });

//Using TypeScript to define prop types
interface MyComponentProps {
  someProp: string;
}

const MyComponent: React.FC<MyComponentProps> = ({ someProp }) => {
  return <Text>{someProp}</Text>;
};
```
