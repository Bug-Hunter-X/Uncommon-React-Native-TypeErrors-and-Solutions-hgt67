This error occurs when you use a component that expects a certain type of prop, but you provide it with a different type.  For example, if a component expects a string prop and you provide it with a number, you'll get a type error. This is particularly common with React Native's built-in components.  Another situation is when you pass a function as a prop and it tries to access `this` in a class component, causing issues in functional components or in a context where `this` is not defined. Improper handling of asynchronous operations, particularly promises, can also lead to type errors if the return type doesn't match expectations.  Finally, using incorrect data types in state updates can cause this. 

```javascript
// Incorrect prop type
<MyComponent someProp={123} /> // someProp expects a string

// Incorrect data type in state
this.setState({ count: 'abc' }); // count expects a number
```
